# Full Stack Development: CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE with Node.js, Express, MySQL, API REST, and ReactJS

##### This project is a complete data management system that employs cutting-edge technologies in web development. It uses Node.js and Express to build a RESTful API that communicates with a MySQL database. The API allows performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the stored data. On the other hand, the user interface is developed with ReactJS, providing an interactive and user-friendly experience for end-users. This combination of technologies offers a robust and scalable solution for developing modern web applications.
